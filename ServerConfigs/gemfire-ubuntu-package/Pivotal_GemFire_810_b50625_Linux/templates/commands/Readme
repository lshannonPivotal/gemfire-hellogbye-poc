In order to install these commands and make them available from within Gfsh you
will need to do the following:

1. Download jsch-0.1.49.jar from http://www.jcraf.com/jsch to the same
   directory as this readme.  If the current version is different, then
   download the latest verion and modify build.xml to match.

2. Ensure that Java and Ant are in your command path and build the Jar file
   using "ant jar".

3. Copy the build-artifacts/gfcommands.jar and jsch-0.1.49.jar files to 
   $GEMFIRE/lib/ext.  You'll probably need to create the directory first.

4. Set the JAVA_ARGS enviroment variable to identify the package where the
   user commands can be found.  On *NIX systems this should work:
   "export JAVA_ARGS=-Dgemfire.user-command-packages=templates/commands"

5. Change directories to $GEMFIRE/bin and run "gfsh".

6. Run the "start remote-locator" or "start remote-server" commands.  You'll
   probably want to start the locator and then server using commands that
   look like this:
   "start remote-locator --host=myhost --user=myuser --password=mypassword
    --gemfire-bin=/usr/local/gemfire/bin --name=mylocator"
   "start remote-locator --host=myhost --user=myuser --password=mypassword
    --gemfire-bin=/usr/local/gemfire/bin --name=myserver"
