This is the XML DTD for defining StatisticsType and StatistDescriptor instances.
All specifications must include a DOCTYPE of the following form:

  <!DOCTYPE statistics PUBLIC
    "-//GemStone Systems, Inc.//GemFire Statistics Type//EN"
    "http://www.gemstone.com/dtd/statisticsType.dtd">

-->

<!--

The following conventions apply to all GemFire statistics type
elements unless indicated otherwise.

- In elements that contain PCDATA, leading and trailing whitespace in
  the data may be ignored.

- In elements whose value is an "enumerated type", the value is case
  sensitive.

-->

<!-- 
The "statistics" element is the root element of the document.
This element identifies which types should be created.
-->
<!ELEMENT statistics (type)+>

<!--  
The "type" element describes a StatisticsType that is to be created.
The "name" attribute specifies the name of the type.
-->
<!ELEMENT type (description?, (stat)+)>
<!ATTLIST type
  name CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!-- 

The "stat" element describes a StatisticDescriptor to add to the type.
attribute should be set to "true".  By default, a stat is a counter
which means its value always increases. If its value may decrease then
set counter to false.

By default larger values of a counter will indicate better performance.
By default smaller values of a gauge will indicate better performance.

By default a stat is stored in 32-bits as an "int". The storage can
be specified to be a 64-bit "long" or "double".

<!--
The "description" element provides a description of a type or stat.
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The unit element specifies the unit ("seconds", "items", "kilograms",
etc.) of the stat's value.
